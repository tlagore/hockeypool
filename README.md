### Overview ###
* hockeypool is a proof of concept web application to interact a database written in php with the twig framework
* the core concept behind the application was database design and not web design. As such, the web application contains code that I would deem to be unusable for any practical purposes as it lacks security (passwords are maintained in plain text, hardcoded passwords to database, etc).
* Please read the FinalProject.pdf to see the details of the database creation from the start to finish
