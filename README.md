### Overview ###
* hockeypool is a proof of concept web application to interact a database written in php with the twig framework
* the core concept behind the application was database design and not web design. As such, the web application contains code that I would deem to be unusable for any practical purposes as it lacks security (passwords are maintained in plain text, hardcoded passwords to database, etc).
* Please read the documents under /documents/ to see the project proposal and final database definition (along with a mock user guide)
* Apologies for the large repo size, there were many large images pushed in the past that are inflating the commit history. I will try to clean up the repo when I have time.
